# sql-challenge

## code sources
- used QuickDBD (https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/NWHpqc) to create the ERD and exported the script as .sql file to show the table schemata.
- used XPert Learning Assistant and class notes to refresh on how to properly join (INNER JOIN) tables.

## other notes
- slightly over-estimated CHAR counts in columns to account for possible data entry mistakes or very long names
- took out "LIMIT 5" test lines of code that I had used to preview the queries for accuracy
